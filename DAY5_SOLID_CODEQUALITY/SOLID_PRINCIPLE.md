Sure! Let‚Äôs break down each of the **SOLID principles** with deeper explanations and more robust **Java code examples** to show how these principles apply in real-world, professional-level applications.

---

### **S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
> **A class should have only one reason to change.**

**‚úÖ What it really means (advanced view):**
SRP is about *cohesion*. A class should encapsulate only one responsibility or concern. If a class does more than one thing, changes in one responsibility may affect or break the other.

---

**‚ùå Bad Example:**
```java
public class InvoiceManager {
    public void calculateTotal() { /* calculation logic */ }
    public void saveToDatabase() { /* save logic */ }
    public void printInvoice() { /* printing logic */ }
}
```

**‚úÖ Refactored (SRP):**
```java
public class InvoiceCalculator {
    public double calculateTotal(Invoice invoice) { /* logic */ return 0.0; }
}

public class InvoiceSaver {
    public void save(Invoice invoice) { /* database logic */ }
}

public class InvoicePrinter {
    public void print(Invoice invoice) { /* printing logic */ }
}
```

**üîç Refactoring Tip:** If your class has more than one *verb* in its name (e.g., Manager, Processor, Handler), split it.

---

### **O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
> **Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.**

**‚úÖ What it really means:**
You should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code. This reduces the risk of bugs in already tested code.

---

**‚ùå Bad Example:**
```java
public class DiscountCalculator {
    public double calculateDiscount(String type) {
        if ("SEASONAL".equals(type)) return 0.1;
        if ("FESTIVAL".equals(type)) return 0.2;
        return 0.0;
    }
}
```

**‚úÖ Refactored with Strategy Pattern:**
```java
public interface DiscountStrategy {
    double getDiscount();
}

public class SeasonalDiscount implements DiscountStrategy {
    public double getDiscount() { return 0.1; }
}

public class FestivalDiscount implements DiscountStrategy {
    public double getDiscount() { return 0.2; }
}

public class DiscountCalculator {
    public double calculate(DiscountStrategy strategy) {
        return strategy.getDiscount();
    }
}
```

**üîç Java Tip:** Use **interfaces and composition** to extend functionality instead of modifying existing classes.

---

### **L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
> **Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.**

**‚úÖ What it really means:**
If a subclass overrides a method, it should honor the contract of the base class. No breaking changes!

---

**‚ùå Bad Example:**
```java
public class Bird {
    public void fly() {}
}

public class Ostrich extends Bird {
    @Override
    public void fly() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Ostrich can't fly!");
    }
}
```

**‚úÖ Solution: Use better abstractions:**
```java
public interface Bird {
    void eat();
}

public interface FlyingBird extends Bird {
    void fly();
}

public class Sparrow implements FlyingBird {
    public void fly() { /* flying logic */ }
    public void eat() {}
}

public class Ostrich implements Bird {
    public void eat() {}
}
```

**üî• Rule of thumb:** *Don't force subclasses to override methods they can't implement meaningfully.*

---

### **I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
> **Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use.**

**‚úÖ What it really means:**
Break large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones so that classes only implement what they need.

---

**‚ùå Bad Example:**
```java
public interface MultiFunctionPrinter {
    void print();
    void scan();
    void fax();
}

public class BasicPrinter implements MultiFunctionPrinter {
    public void print() { }
    public void scan() { throw new UnsupportedOperationException(); }
    public void fax() { throw new UnsupportedOperationException(); }
}
```

**‚úÖ Better with Interface Segregation:**
```java
public interface Printer {
    void print();
}

public interface Scanner {
    void scan();
}

public class BasicPrinter implements Printer {
    public void print() { }
}
```

**üîç Refactoring Tip:** Keep interfaces *focused* and *minimal*.

---

### **D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
> **High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.**

**‚úÖ What it really means:**
Depend on **interfaces**, not **concrete implementations**. This decouples high-level logic from low-level details.

---

**‚ùå Bad Example:**
```java
public class OrderService {
    private StripePaymentProcessor processor = new StripePaymentProcessor();
    
    public void checkout() {
        processor.pay(100.0);
    }
}
```

**‚úÖ Better with DIP (and Dependency Injection):**
```java
public interface PaymentProcessor {
    void pay(double amount);
}

public class StripePaymentProcessor implements PaymentProcessor {
    public void pay(double amount) { /* stripe logic */ }
}

public class OrderService {
    private final PaymentProcessor processor;

    public OrderService(PaymentProcessor processor) {
        this.processor = processor;
    }

    public void checkout() {
        processor.pay(100.0);
    }
}
```

Now `OrderService` can work with any `PaymentProcessor`, like PayPal or Razorpay, without any code change.
