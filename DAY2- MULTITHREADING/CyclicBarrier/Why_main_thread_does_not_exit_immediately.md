# üßµ Why `main()` Doesn't Exit Immediately in Java (Thread Behavior Explained)

## ‚ùì The Confusion

You might notice that your `main()` method finishes executing, but the program **doesn‚Äôt terminate**. For example:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    dummy dummy = new dummy();
    dummy.test();
    for(int i=0; i<4; i++){
        new Thread(dummy.task, "Thread" + i).start();
    }
    System.out.println("main thread done");
}
```

You see `"main thread done"` printed, yet the program stays alive. Why?

## üîç JVM Thread Lifecycle Rule

> The **JVM will stay alive** as long as **any non-daemon thread is running**.

Your worker threads (created using `new Thread(...)`) are **non-daemon by default**. This means:
- Even though `main()` has completed 
- The JVM **waits for all your threads to finish**

‚úÖ So:
- `"hello"` prints ‚úÖ
- `main()` ends ‚úÖ
- JVM **waits** for all threads to finish ‚ùó

---

## ‚úÖ How to Confirm

You can add a print to the end of `main()`:

```java
System.out.println("main thread done");
```

You‚Äôll see this prints before the other threads finish ‚Äî confirming `main()` ended, but JVM didn‚Äôt shut down yet.

## üí• Want `main()` to exit and kill other threads?

You have two options:

### üîπ 1. Set threads as Daemon

```java
Thread t = new Thread(dummy.task, "Thread" + i);
t.setDaemon(true);  // JVM will not wait for daemon threads
t.start();
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Daemon threads are killed when the main thread exits.

### üîπ 2. Use `ExecutorService` (Cleaner Approach)

```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);
for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    executor.submit(dummy.task);
}
executor.shutdown(); // JVM exits after all tasks finish
```

## üß† Summary

| Aspect                       | Behavior                  |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------|
| `main()` finishes            | ‚úÖ Yes                    |
| JVM exits immediately        | ‚ùå No (non-daemon threads still alive) |
| Fix with daemon threads      | ‚úÖ JVM will exit if only daemons remain |
| Fix with ExecutorService     | ‚úÖ Recommended clean approach |
