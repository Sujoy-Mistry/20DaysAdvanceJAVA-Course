# Understanding ExecutorService in Java

Let's go through the code step by step and break it down clearly.

```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(8);
```

## What is ExecutorService?

- `ExecutorService` is part of the `java.util.concurrent` package.
- It provides a high-level way of managing threads—specifically thread pools—so you don't have to create and manage threads manually.

## `Executors.newFixedThreadPool(8)`

- This creates a thread pool with **8 threads**.
- The pool can run up to **8 tasks concurrently** (at the same time).
- If you submit more than 8 tasks, extra tasks will wait in a queue until a thread becomes available.

```java
executor.submit(() -> {
    System.out.println("Task executed by: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
});
```

## What does this do?

- `executor.submit(...)` submits a task to be executed by one of the 8 threads in the pool.
- The task here is a simple lambda expression `(() -> { ... })`, which is shorthand for creating a `Runnable` or `Callable`.
- The task prints the name of the thread that executes it using:

```java
Thread.currentThread().getName()
```

### Output Example:

```text
Task executed by: pool-1-thread-3
```

```java
executor.shutdown();
```

## Why shutdown?

- `shutdown()` is used to gracefully shut down the executor.

### This means:
- No new tasks will be accepted.
- Already submitted tasks will be allowed to complete.

⚠️ Without calling `shutdown()`, the program might keep running because the thread pool threads are non-daemon threads, which keep the JVM alive.

---

## ✅ Summary

This code:

- Creates a pool of 8 threads.
- Submits one task to the pool.
- The task prints which thread ran it.
- Then the pool is shut down gracefully.

### Output Example:

```text
Task executed by: pool-1-thread-1
```

## Next Step

Do you want to add more tasks to the pool or see how to handle results from them (using `Future`, etc.)?
