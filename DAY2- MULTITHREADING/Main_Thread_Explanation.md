# Understanding the Main Thread in Java

Yes, the **main thread** in Java (or in most programming languages) executes **line by line**, just like any other thread. However, there's more nuance to it when you're working with **multithreading**, as the main thread can spawn other threads and manage parallel tasks.

---

## 1. Main Thread Starts Execution

- When you run a Java application, the **main thread** is the first thread that starts executing. This thread begins at the **`main()` method**.
- The main thread executes the code **sequentially**, meaning it processes one line after the other, unless there's a specific mechanism to alter this flow (e.g., starting other threads or waiting for certain events).

## 2. Main Thread Executes Line by Line

```java
public class MainThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("First line");
        System.out.println("Second line");
        System.out.println("Third line");
    }
}
```

- The main thread will print each line in order, sequentially.

---

## 3. What Happens When Other Threads Are Involved?

```java
public class MainThreadWithOtherThreads {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Main thread starting");

        Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
            System.out.println("Task executed by a new thread");
        });

        thread.start();

        System.out.println("Main thread continues");
    }
}
```

### Execution Flow:
1. Main thread starts and prints "Main thread starting".
2. A new thread is created and started.
3. Main thread continues its execution and prints "Main thread continues".
4. New thread executes its task and prints "Task executed by a new thread".

---

## 4. Thread Execution Flow with join()

```java
public class MainThreadWithJoin {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        System.out.println("Main thread starting");

        Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
            System.out.println("Task executed by a new thread");
        });

        thread.start();

        thread.join();

        System.out.println("Main thread continues after thread completes");
    }
}
```

- `thread.join()` makes the main thread wait for the new thread to finish before continuing.

---

## 5. What Happens If the Main Thread Is Blocked?

- Blocking methods like `join()`, `sleep()`, or `wait()` cause the main thread to **pause**.
- In multithreaded scenarios, you can use methods like `awaitTermination()` in `ExecutorService` to block until tasks finish.

---

## 6. Concurrency vs Sequential Execution

- Main thread runs **sequentially**.
- New threads run **concurrently**.
- Main thread continues its flow unless it is **blocked** or told to **wait** for other threads.

---

## âœ… Summary

- Main thread executes line by line unless told to wait or work with other threads.
- Threads run independently but can be coordinated using `join()` or similar methods.
- Concurrency introduces asynchronous behavior, but the main thread still follows its own sequential path unless interrupted.
