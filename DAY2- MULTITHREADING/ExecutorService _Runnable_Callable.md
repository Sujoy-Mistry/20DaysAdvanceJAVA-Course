# Understanding ExecutorService in Java

Let's go through the code step by step and break it down clearly.

```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(8);
```

## What is ExecutorService?

- `ExecutorService` is part of the `java.util.concurrent` package.
- It provides a high-level way of managing threads—specifically thread pools—so you don't have to create and manage threads manually.

## `Executors.newFixedThreadPool(8)`

- This creates a thread pool with **8 threads**.
- The pool can run up to **8 tasks concurrently** (at the same time).
- If you submit more than 8 tasks, extra tasks will wait in a queue until a thread becomes available.

```java
executor.submit(() -> {
    System.out.println("Task executed by: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
});
```

## What does this do?

- `executor.submit(...)` submits a task to be executed by one of the 8 threads in the pool.
- The task here is a simple lambda expression `(() -> { ... })`, which is shorthand for creating a `Runnable` or `Callable`.
- The task prints the name of the thread that executes it using:

```java
Thread.currentThread().getName()
```

### Output Example:

```text
Task executed by: pool-1-thread-3
```

```java
executor.shutdown();
```

## Why shutdown?

- `shutdown()` is used to gracefully shut down the executor.

### This means:
- No new tasks will be accepted.
- Already submitted tasks will be allowed to complete.

⚠️ Without calling `shutdown()`, the program might keep running because the thread pool threads are non-daemon threads, which keep the JVM alive.

---

## ✅ Summary

This code:

- Creates a pool of 8 threads.
- Submits one task to the pool.
- The task prints which thread ran it.
- Then the pool is shut down gracefully.

### Output Example:

```text
Task executed by: pool-1-thread-1
```

# Understanding Runnable vs Callable in Java Lambda Expressions

Let's take a closer look at this line:

```java
executor.submit(() -> {
    System.out.println("Task executed by: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
});
```

## Lambda Expression Breakdown

This part:

```java
() -> {
    System.out.println("Task executed by: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
}
```

...is a **lambda expression**, and it's being passed as an argument to `executor.submit(...)`.

---

## 🧠 Runnable vs Callable

### 🔹 Runnable

Represents a task that:

- Takes no input
- Returns no result
- Can throw only **unchecked exceptions**

It's used when you just want to run something, like printing or updating something.

```java
Runnable task = () -> {
    System.out.println("I'm a Runnable!");
};
```

### 🔹 Callable<T>

Represents a task that:

- Takes no input
- Returns a result of type `T`
- Can throw **checked exceptions**

It's used when you want the task to return a value or potentially throw a checked exception.

```java
Callable<String> task = () -> {
    return "I'm a Callable!";
};
```

---

## What does `submit(...)` accept?

`ExecutorService` has overloaded `submit(...)` methods that accept both:

- `submit(Runnable task)`
- `submit(Callable<T> task)`

---

## ✅ Your Code:

```java
executor.submit(() -> {
    System.out.println("Task executed by: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
});
```

This lambda returns `void`, so Java treats it as a **Runnable**.

---

## ❓ What if you wanted to use Callable?

Just return something:

```java
Future<String> future = executor.submit(() -> {
    return "Executed by: " + Thread.currentThread().getName();
});

System.out.println(future.get()); // Blocks and prints the returned string
```

- The lambda returns a `String`, so it is a `Callable<String>`.
- `submit()` returns a `Future<String>`.

---

## ✅ Summary

- Your lambda `(() -> System.out.println(...))` matches the **Runnable** functional interface.
- If your lambda **returns something**, Java treats it as a **Callable<T>**.
- `submit()` can handle both, but `Runnable` doesn’t return anything unless you use this form:

```java
Future<?> f = executor.submit(Runnable task, T result);
```
