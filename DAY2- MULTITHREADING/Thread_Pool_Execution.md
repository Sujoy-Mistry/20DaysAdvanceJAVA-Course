# Understanding Execution Time with Varying Thread Pool Sizes in Java

When using multithreading in Java, you may observe that:

- With **1 thread**, execution time can be **0 milliseconds**.
- With **10 threads**, execution time may rise to **2 milliseconds**.

This is often due to how the JVM handles task scheduling and thread management.

## üß† Key Concepts to Understand

### 1. Task Execution Overhead
Even for quick tasks (e.g., print statements), there is overhead in submitting and managing them with `ExecutorService`.

### 2. Thread Pool Creation & Task Scheduling
- **Single thread**: Executes tasks sequentially with minimal overhead.
- **Multiple threads**: Involves scheduling, task distribution, and thread management, introducing slight delays.

---

## ‚ö° Why 0 Milliseconds for 1 Thread?

- **Sequential execution**: One thread processes tasks one after the other.
- **Minimal management overhead**: No need to manage concurrency or multiple threads.
- **Lightweight task**: Printing is fast, and JVM optimizations may reduce perceived execution time to zero.

---

## üßµ Why 2 Milliseconds for 10 Threads?

- **Thread management overhead**: Creating and scheduling tasks for multiple threads takes time.
- **Task distribution**: Tasks are dispatched across threads, increasing coordination effort.
- **Lightweight tasks**: The smaller the task, the more the management overhead dominates.

---

## üîç Internals at Play

- **1 Thread**: Executes everything sequentially.
- **10 Threads**: Requires:
  - Thread initialization
  - Task queuing and context switching
  - Managing thread lifecycle (even briefly)

---

## üß™ Important Factors

1. **Task Size**: Small, fast tasks exaggerate overhead differences.
2. **System Load**: Background processes can influence thread scheduling.
3. **Thread Pool Overhead**: More threads = more overhead.

---

## üîß Measuring Accurately

For better measurements:

- Use **more tasks** to smooth out anomalies.
- Include **real work** in tasks (e.g., I/O, math operations).
- Use `System.nanoTime()` for high-resolution timing.

---

## üß† Real-World Context

In real applications, tasks are rarely this lightweight. For compute-heavy or I/O tasks:

- Multiple threads yield **significant performance benefits**.
- Overhead becomes negligible compared to task execution time.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Threads | Execution Time | Notes |
|---------|----------------|-------|
| 1       | ~0 ms          | Minimal overhead, sequential execution |
| 10      | ~2 ms          | Small scheduling overhead appears |

**Conclusion**: Overhead is more noticeable with multiple threads only when tasks are trivial. For heavier tasks, multithreading shines.
